# 📊 SmartMart Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the SmartMart EDA project! This repository contains the exploratory data analysis conducted for **SmartMart**, aimed at uncovering insights from their retail data to support better business decision-making.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to perform a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on SmartMart's dataset to:

- Understand the structure and distribution of data
- Identify key patterns and trends
- Detect anomalies or outliers
- Generate business insights
- Set a strong foundation for future predictive modeling or dashboarding efforts

📌 Key Questions Addressed
During the analysis, several business-critical questions were explored, including:

- What are the top-performing product categories?

- Which locations generate the most revenue?

- Are there any seasonal patterns in sales?

- What is the customer purchasing behavior?

- Are there any data quality issues (e.g. missing values, duplicates)?

🔍 EDA Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values, duplicates, incorrect types

- Univariate Analysis

Distribution of key numerical and categorical features

- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Correlation heatmaps, pair plots, grouped bar charts

- Time Series Exploration

Trends and seasonality in sales over time

- Outlier Detection

Boxplots, z-score analysis

- Data Visualization

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (interactive where needed)

## 📊 Highlights & Key Insights

- 🏆 Category X contributes the most to total revenue.

- 📍 City Y shows consistent sales growth quarter-over-quarter.

- 🕒 Peak sales occur in Month Z, likely due to seasonal demand.

- 🧾 Customer Segment A shows higher average transaction value.

- ⚠️ Data inconsistencies were found in the invoice_date column.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Languages: Python 3.x

### Libraries:

- pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
